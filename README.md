## Getting Started

The website is live at https://projectoutdoors.netlify.app/

### To test it locally

1. Clone the repo

```
git@github.com:Sauptik23/Project_outdoors.git
```

2. Install the project dependencies:

```
npm install
```

3. Compile the Sass code:

```
npm run start
```

4. Start the live server to see the website:

```
 live-server
```

5. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

### Sass Compilation

Project_outdoors uses Sass for styling. All Sass files are located in the `sass/main.scss` directory. The compiled CSS files are placed in the `css/style.css` directory.

To compile the Sass code, run the following command:

```
npm run start
```

This will automatically compile all Sass files in the `sass/main.scss` directory and place the compiled CSS files in the `css/style.css` directory.

### Live Server

Live-Server is used as a development server to see the website changes in real-time. To start the live server, run the following command:

```
 live-server
```

This will start the live server at http://localhost:3000. Any changes you make to the HTML, CSS, or Sass files will be automatically reflected in the browser.
